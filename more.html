            1)Add your number to the National Do Not Call Registry: The National Do Not Call Registry is a free service provided by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that allows you to add your phone number to a list of numbers that telemarketers are not allowed to call. You can add your number to the list by visiting the Do Not Call website (donotcall.gov) or by calling 1-888-382-1222 from the phone you want to register.<br>
            2)Use a call blocking app: There are many call blocking apps available for smartphones that can help filter out unwanted calls. These apps use databases of known spam numbers to identify and block incoming calls. Some popular call blocking apps include Truecaller, Hiya, and Nomorobo.<br>
            3)Be cautious with your phone number: Be careful when giving out your phone number online or in person. Some companies may sell your phone number to telemarketers, which can result in an increase in spam calls.<br>
            Don't answer calls from unknown numbers: If you receive a call from a number you don't recognize, let it go to voicemail. If it's a legitimate call, the caller will leave a message.

            <summary style="color: darkgreen"><font size="4px">SPAM ON EMAILS</font></summary>
            1)Use a spam filter: Most email services offer a spam filter that can automatically detect and move spam messages to a separate folder. Check your email settings to make sure the spam filter is enabled.<br>
            2)Be cautious about giving out your email address: Be careful about giving out your email address to businesses or individuals you don't know. If you do provide your email address, ask how it will be used and whether it will be shared with third parties.<br>
            3)Don't respond to spam emails: If you receive a spam email, don't respond to it. Replying to the email can confirm to the sender that your email address is active and may result in more spam messages.<br>
            4)Unsubscribe from mailing lists: If you receive emails from a mailing list that you no longer want to receive, look for an unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email. Clicking the link should remove you from the mailing list.<br>
            5)Mark as spam: Most email services have a button or option to mark an email as spam. Doing so can help train the spam filter to better identify and block spam messages.<br>
             ***By taking these steps, you can reduce the amount of spam you receive and protect yourself from potential phishing or malware attacks. Additionally, you can also consider using a disposable email address or creating a separate email address for online transactions to further reduce the amount of spam you receive.***
